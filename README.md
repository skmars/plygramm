## About
Plygramm is an absolutely free platform to learn grammar of several different languages in parallel. 

 - The main idea based on comparative grammar approach.
 - Here the computer would suggest 3 different languages mostly in one language family to combine. But the last decision is for you.
 - The platform is designed to skill you up predominately in grammar. So, knowing alphabet of a chosen languages is a must.


## Features

- learn one grammatical concept in three languages at a time
- check your understanding of the concept having a rule on the same screen
- pass a complex task on the passed rules
- ask teachers questions, make notes
- become a teacher and make your own tasks
- âœ¨feel your bilingual growing upâœ¨

We, People couldn't live without structures. Grammar is a type of instructure we use to communicate.
To communicate with all living and nonliving objects. It'as everywhere.
As famous designer _Charles James_ wrote:

So we have _single resposobolity_ in Computer Science in OOP as a first SOLID principle.

## Tech

Plygramm uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - major backend language (v3.10)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - legend web framework for Python (v4.1)
- [Django Rest](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - flexible toolkit for building Web API (v3.14)
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/#) - reliable distributed asynchronous task queue system (v5.2.7)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)- message broker to mediate between clients (v4.4.0)
- [Flake8, Black](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) - usefull linters to beutify python code
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - DB 


And of course Plygramm itself will be open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
