## About

Plygramm is a free platform to learn grammar of different languages in parallell. 
The main idea based on comparative grammar approach.
Here we would have 3 different lagugaes mostly in one language family. 
 - jfjf
- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- âœ¨Magic âœ¨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Plygramm uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - major backend language (v3.10)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - legend web framework for Python (v4.1)
- [Django Rest](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - flexible toolkit for building Web API (v3.14)
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/#) - reliable distributed asynchronous task queue system (v5.2.7)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)- message broker to mediate between clients (v4.4.0)
- [Flake8, Black](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) - usefull linters to beutify python code
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - DB 


And of course Plygramm itself will be open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
